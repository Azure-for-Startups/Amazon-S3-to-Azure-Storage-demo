# Amazon S3 to Azure Storage
Command line cross cloud copy tool

# Abstract (May 2016)
The following is a ‘how to’ code sample and library that can be used for recursive copy storage structure from Amazon S3 to Azure storage.  The library also can be used and integrated in any custom solution.

# Prerequisites
- Azure storage account
- Amazon S3 Account
- Visual Studio 2015

# Introduction
The S3 to Azure sample illustrates basic principles of copying from Amazon S3 bucket to Azure Storage blob container. The sample tool enables multithreaded asynchronous recursive copying of bucket folder structure and files matching the provided path prefix. A local connection is used to data transfer. The server side copying available on Azure is out of score for this sample. Also this sample is an illustration and is not intended to be a production ready application, but it can be used as is and extended for specific user scenarios
